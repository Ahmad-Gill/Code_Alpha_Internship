🎉 Just wrapped up my final project at CodeAlpha - A/B Testing on 500 user posts with labeled categories! 💻 This project was a fascinating exploration into understanding user behavior and preferences through statistical analysis and data-driven insights.

📊 Leveraging my automated coding skills, I seamlessly handled tasks such as loading the dataset, preprocessing text, encoding labels, splitting the data, performing statistical analysis, utilizing the CHI square distribution, and visualizing results with plots.

🔍 Through meticulous analysis, we uncovered valuable insights into user engagement and interaction patterns. These insights not only shed light on user preferences but also provided actionable recommendations for optimizing user experience and content strategy.

💡 Excited to apply these learnings and insights in future projects, and grateful for the opportunity to grow and learn at CodeAlpha! Stay tuned for more updates on my journey. #CodeAlpha #ABTesting #DataScience #UserEngagement #StatisticalAnalysis
