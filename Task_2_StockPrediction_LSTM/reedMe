ðŸŽ‰ I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed my second task during my internship at CodeAlpha! ðŸš€ This time, I had the opportunity to dive into stock price prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models - an exciting venture into the world of financial data analysis.

ðŸ’¼ One of the key highlights of this project was the development of an automated code framework. From the initial step of loading the dataset to the final stage of model creation, the code handled every aspect of the process seamlessly. This included classifying columns, preprocessing the data, filling missing values, selecting relevant features, visualizing insights with box plots, removing outliers, and ultimately constructing the LSTM model itself.

ðŸ“ˆ What sets this approach apart is its efficiency and reusability. By automating these tasks, not only was the workflow streamlined, but it also ensured consistency and accuracy across different datasets. With just a simple input file, the entire analysis could be replicated effortlessly, freeing up valuable time for deeper exploration and interpretation of the results.

ðŸ”¥ I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work on such impactful projects at CodeAlpha. Each task pushes me to expand my skills and knowledge in the field of data science, and I'm excited to take on more challenges in the future! ðŸ’¡ #CodeAlpha #InternshipJourney #StockPrediction #DataScience #AutomatedCoding
