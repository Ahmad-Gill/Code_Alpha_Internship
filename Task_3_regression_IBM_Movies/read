🚀 Just completed my third task at CodeAlpha - Regression for IBM Movie Rating Prediction! 🎬 This project was all about harnessing the power of automation to streamline the analysis process.

💼 Utilizing my automated coding skills, I seamlessly handled tasks such as loading the dataset, classifying columns, preprocessing, removing outliers, feature selection, model selection, training the best model, and visualizing the results - all without the need for any manual hard-coded interventions.

📊 The most exciting part? We didn't settle for just any model. After rigorously testing three different models, we selected the best one based on accuracy. This data-driven approach ensures that we're always working with the most reliable and effective solution.

🔍 Excited to continue pushing boundaries and exploring new challenges at CodeAlpha! Stay tuned for more updates on my internship journey. 💡 #CodeAlpha #DataScience #Regression #AutomatedAnalysis #InternshipJourney
